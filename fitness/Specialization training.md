Specialization training is a method employed in resistance training in which for a given time frame (let’s say 3 months) for 2 to 3 muscle groups get more attention than the rest of the muscles to maximize muscle growth in a shorter amount of time.

### Why this way works?

Recovery plays a huge role in muscle building, when your muscles are recovering, that is the time they are growing. So because of that there is a systemic fatigue involved in working out. When you target all the muscles very hard, then your entire body needs to recover which can take more time (days) and this will affect training frequency and intensity. So in order to reduce the **systemic fatigue**, picking 2 to 3 muscle groups first and considering them as the main target during a course of (let’s say 1 to 3 months) could increase the chance of growth in those muscle very quicker than training every one of them.

### How many muscles?
To choose how many muscles to include in your specialization training, how much systemic fatigue the training for that muscle is inducing should be considered. For example, [[Lateral deltoids]] cause less fatigue when compared to [[Quadriceps]] training. So the answer is how many every muscle that could be included without increasing the systemic fatigue. An example would be bicep, lateral deltoids and chest could be an option. 

### How to execute this?

1. Choose **2 to 3 muscle groups**, if you have a bigger muscle group like quads and back, choose only 2 muscle groups, else go with 3.
2. Now these muscle groups will have higher training intensity and training frequency.
3. Training frequency should be around **3 to 4 times** per week! Whenever your muscle group is healed, implement a training.
4. Sets and reps should be decided based on how you are recovering, if you are recovering in a day, increase the sets and reps. If it is taking a long time to recover, reduce or maintain the sets and reps as your body can quickly adapt!
5. To increase intensity, techniques like **isometric hold and long length partials** can be employed.
6. The other muscle groups should be trained but not very frequently and intense. For example going for 2 times a week with less intensity is suggested.

This framework works very well when you want to focus on one particular muscle group’s size. It leverages your body’s recovery capability.
