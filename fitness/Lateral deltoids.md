Lateral deltoids are aesthetically very important muscles because they increase the frame for a person. This is a major factor in achieving the U[[V-Taper]] look. And it is comparatively easy to recover when compared to other muscles. There are several workouts to target the lateral deltoids,
1. Lateral raises
2. Single arm lateral raises
3. Lu raises / Full ROM lateral raises
4. Upright rows
### Techniques for optimal training
- Lateral deltoids work much better in low weight high rep style training (20 to 30 reps)
- If [[Specialization training]] is implemented, then It can be trained 4 times a week.
- [[Myo-reps]] and [[Long length Partials]] are a great way to induce muscular fatigue to the muscle.
- To progressively overload, increase the weight by 1 kg or increase reps.
- To increase the muscular fatigue to feel the burn, the following tricks could be implemented.
	- [[Slow Eccentric]] movement
	- [[Isometric hold]]
	- [[One and half reps]]
	- [[Drop sets]]
