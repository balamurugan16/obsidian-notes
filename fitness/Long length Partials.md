A full range of motion has 2 parts, the short length partial which happens during the squeeze and a long length partials which happens during the stretch.
A muscle should be targeted in 2 phases, the **squeeze** and the **stretch** and when it comes to the fatigue and more muscular damage, the stretch causes the more damage than the squeeze. And this is what **long length partial** is targeting, the stretch of the muscle.
There are a lot of researches on long length partials where it proved that it is better than short length partials, and in some cases, better than **full range of motion**.

- Long length partials can be used to finish any set post hitting almost failure. This is better because it extends the fatigue and gives you more muscular hypertrophy. This can be done for pullups, pulldowns, hamstring curls etc.
- Long length partials can be employed in all the reps on the last set of a particular workout. This is also a good approach to increase hypertrophy.
- Some times, one full rep one half rep can also be done which will keep the workout fun and causes a good pump.
