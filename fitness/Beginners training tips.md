### Technique
Learning the right technique early is key because 
- It will travel with them throughout their fitness journey
- Instead of focusing on lifting more weights, focusing on the technique is very important.
- This is a future investment for a beginner.
- Taking newbie gains into consideration, No need to focus on the weight, going to failure and other hypertrophy principles.
### Lean on the basics of free weights
As a beginner, the workouts should mostly evolve around free weights rather than machines. Because a person who learned how to squat can easily go and perform leg press, but a person trained only in leg press is going to have a hard time with learning squats. Always the basic free weight workouts are king when it comes to the technique, because beginners always lose the balance when they are performing the movements.
Design a routine that has 70% of compound free weight movements and 30% of workouts with machines, cables, and dumbbells.
### Work mostly in the 5 - 10 rep ranges
In general, the ideal [[Rep range]] for hypertrophy is around 5 to 30 reps. Anything below 5 is for powerlifting and anything above 30 is endurance stuff.
For beginners, starting from 5 reps makes sure the muscle is challenged enough, and stopping at 10 is because the beginner doesn't need to train till failure in the initial stages. 
Doing a lot of reps leads to Cardiovascular fatigue (refer [[Types of Fatigue]]) which may hinder the performance and recovery. So sticking at 5 to 10 reps is ideal.
### Technique earns progression
When the technique is really good, and the beginner is able to perform the reps without hitting failure or a hint of failure, this gives a room for progression, so we can increase the weight and sticking to the same 5 to 10 rep range. This is called [[Progressive overload]]
If the technique is compromised before the 5 to 10 rep range, there is no progression required.
### Patience and positivity
Beginners usually mess up, expect early results for the hard work they are putting in, and very prone to feel insecure and lose motivation for working out. The saying "Patience is a virtue" is very important to keep in mind because it does take time to build a great body, so enjoy the process, enjoy the progression and focus on the process,  the results will speak for itselves.
