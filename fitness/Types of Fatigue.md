There are different types of Fatigue in resistance training context.

1. **Muscular fatigue:** When your muscle is very sore and couldn’t take any more reps.
2. **Cardio vascular fatigue:** When you are unable to perform any more reps because you breathe a lot. This happens a lot with [[Compound movements]] , especially squats and deadlifts, and also performing cardio.
4. **Psychological fatigue:** This is when your mind is completely not motivated to workout due to external stress like your work, relationship, or even you are tired of working out and can’t take it anymore.

Apart from this, lack of sleep could cause fatigue, circadian rhythm out of sync could cause fatigue and the list goes on.

Fatigue acts as a signal for us to act upon it. If your muscles are fatigued, it is better to give some extra rest than usual, or even ending the workout if you are done with it. Fatigue management is crucial for long term benefits. If you push through your muscular fatigue, it may lead to overtraining which diminishes the chances of building muscle. If you push through your cardio vascular fatigue, it could lead to injury or serious health issue. And if you push through your psychological fatigue, then there is a good chance for you to skip the gym, or lose focus when you are working out which may lead to poor results.

Fatigue management is critical and being aware of your body, identifying the fatigue and acting upon it quickly is very important. Some of the methods to manage your fatigue are,

1. **Proper sleep at appropriate timings:** 7 to 8 hour sleep is must, and also you should sleep at the right timings, let’s say 10 PM to 6 AM. This is in sync with the circadian rhythm which aids in reduced cortisol level (Stress hormone).
2. **Cheat meals:** One of the biggest psychological fatigue is the “Diet fatigue” where you are completely bored with the usual diet food. Having a cheat meal once or twice a day will completely help you to build that momentum. Compromising calories from other macros for one cheat meal which could make you go on in the long run is a great and sustainable idea.
3. **Portion control:** If you are concerned with your cheat meal, then you could try portion controlling where you could take some sort of tastier meal in a smaller portion which could control your cravings. For example, Splitting your food into half and eating the half alone, opting for low calorie snacks. These will make sure you are not having a diet fatigue.
4. **Rest days:** Rest days are very critical and those are the days where your body completely rests. Taking extra 2 hours to sleep, reducing activity, having your cheat meals could be some of the activities that you could do on your rest days. Rest days are not only for the body but also for your mind. So try to ignore negativity and stay happy by spending time with your loved ones, watching movies etc.
