Arms are a muscle group that is known for recovering quicker for the vast majority of people. This note is about Arms [[Specialization training]]. Relatively speaking, arms should be trained in the following way to achieve major growth. So there are fundamentally 10 principles in Arm training that should be followed.

1. **Strict technique**
    Technique allows to target the muscle that is getting trained and neglects the other muscles which are involved.
2. **Deep stretches**
    Always focusing on a deep stretch because the stretch increases the fatigue which causes growth. The stretch is very important, during the end of the set you can try using the [[Long length Partials]]
3. **Try all rep ranges for best Stimulus to Fatigue ratio**
    Experimenting with all the [[Rep range]] like heavy weight 6 - 8 reps, light weight 20 to 30 reps, or even drop sets. Try to find out the optimal rep range and focus.
4. **Training arms first / early / independently**
    If trained with other muscles like back and chest, always train the arms first and then go to the other muscle.
    Most possibly, do an arm workout independently or with a muscle that is not completely related to your arm like calves or glutes.
5. **Multiple variants vs Optimal movements**
    There is no best workout for bicep and tricep, so always flip workouts, one day do Preacher curl and the next day do a Spider curl. Here the variation should follow the first 3 rules and that is all matters!
6. **Try compound post exhausts**
    Post working on the isolation workouts, go ahead and do a compound workout for exhausting the arms like chinups or close grip bench press.
7. **Train arms as often as they recover**
    Since arms recover faster than the other muscles, it is a good idea to increase the frequency and train it once it is completely healed. It is possible to train arms for 3 or 4 days as well.
8. **Back off on the rest**
    If your major focus is building arms, backing off on other muscle is generally a good idea. Reduce to maintenance volume on the others and focus on arms more.
9. **Eat more protein and calories**
    In order to get big, you need to be in a caloric surplus, with more protein and calories
10. **Grind for few months and take a break**
    After grinding for a few months, back off and give your arms some rest by reducing the volume.
